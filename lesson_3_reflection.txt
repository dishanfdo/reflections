When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When the work you are doing is shared between several people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It will distract your focus and flow of work.
Cause un necessary conflicts while merging the pulled content with your content.
